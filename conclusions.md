# Conclusions
Overall, we found our project to be very successful. Our requirements were somewhat dynamic up until about Spring Break because we were not sure what exactly we would be able to get done. It eventually came down to having a basic GUI and being able to connect to the database, both of which we successfully accomplished. These changes to the requirements did not change our design much and allowed us to produce a better base and worry less about details. We faced several difficulties as a result of our design choices. We learned that Qt is a very particular library and must have things exactly right or it will fail. It also did not work well with another library we choose Boost, which was used to make file saving on Mac and PC easier. These led us to many uncessary headaches. If we were to do the project all over again, we would use something other than Qt.
