## Module Description and Flow
Each tab will have its own class. Each button will have a method associated with it. 

The GUI is separated into four parts. The top ribbon has normal functions (file, save, open) and other basic functions for modeling. There are three tabs. This is the basic layout.

The right portion displays the information retrieved from the database. It has three tabs. These tabs are General Info, Vehicle Info, and Occupant Info. Each Tab will fill up the screen with info when they are clicked. The labels will be to the left and the info to the right.
This has changed from the original design of using tabs.

This is the original design implemented.
