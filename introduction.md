# Project Introduction
<br>
A desktop 3D application that can import car crash and/or crime scene data and use point clouds and line work to create a 3D model
of the crash/crime scene. This desktop application will be graphics based and coupled with a physics engine library to complete 
a simulation of the crash or crime scene. This application will work with a mobile application that collects data and a server/database
that stores the information. These projects are being worked on by other teams. 
<br><br>
With law enforcement as one of the main customers, Delta V Innovations also intends to offer this software application to numerous 
users including but not limited to insurance agencies, private investigators, and car manufacturers. Customers will be able to use 
the mobile application in the field to collect data, use the desktop application to view, edit, and finalize the data into a 3D model.
