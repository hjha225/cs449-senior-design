# Shelby's Weekly Updates

## Week of 2/5
We started off the week with a meeting on Monday. We discussed how we
were handling the website, since it needed to be done the most
immediately. We also began working on the fundamentals of the project.

The first of these is the requirements, which we decided to rewrite
in our own words to ensure we are on the same page as the customer. The
second is the GUI, since it is necessary for the other
components to fit in, and the importance of the UI was emphasized by the
customer previously.

During this period, we also set up lines of communication and
collaboration over Slack and GitHub. I made a temporary website
containing a draft of the requirements and team/project intros.


## Week of 2/12
On Monday, my temporary website was replaced by Hannah and Tricia with
the current (much nicer) website, hosted on GitHub within a separate
repository. I installed Jekyll so I could run a copy of the website
on my computer for faster testing with fewer redundant commits, and
proceeded to pretty it up a little by moving the links to the sidebar.

Throughout the week, I spent some time researching the Qt framework,
which we plan on using for our GUI, mostly looking into licensing, e.g.
will the customer need to pay for it, and if so, how much would it be?
Mike's attorney concluded what I suspected: we could use it for free
under the LGPL license by meeting a few simple requirements revolving
around allowing the user to relink Qt and get its source code.

On Friday, I met with Tricia and Hannah to install Qt, and I worked
through a simple tutorial involving layouts and buttons to start
familiarizing myself with the framework.


## Week of 2/19

This was a busy week in other classes, for me and others,
so we weren't able to meet much this week. Most of my efforts simply
went into better familiarizing myself with QT, and planning for next week.


## Week of 2/26

We met with Mike to evaluate where each team is at and where it is headed, as well as to iron out design 
kinks and make sure teams are keeping sufficiently in touch. He suggested that we each have at least one 
member of our team drop in on each other team's meetings.

We also put some deadlines on our work, such as piecing the GUI together and having at least a 'handshake' 
with the database by spring break, as well as a soft cutoff for adding to the project, to leave room for 
testing and prettying everything up for the project to be smoothly continued by others.

Finally, we practiced our presentation for the following Monday at PresentationU on Thursday. I think it 
went well, though we need to be sure to lengthen it and present with some enthusiasm.


## Week of 3/5

We began the week with our midterm presentation to the class on Monday. While I am not certain how we did 
on length, overall, I believe it was a success.

I will continue the week by piecing my part of the GUI with Tricia's. If things take longer than planned, 
I will have plenty of time to ameliorate things over the break.
