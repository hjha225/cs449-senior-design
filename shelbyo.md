# Shelby's Weekly Updates

## Week of 2/5
We started off the week with a meeting on Monday. We discussed how we 
were handling the website, since it needed to be done the most 
immediately. We also began working on the fundamentals of the project.

The first of these is the requirements, which we decided to rewrite 
in our own words to ensure we are on the same page as the customer. The 
second is the GUI, since it is necessary for the other 
components to fit in, and the importance of the UI was emphasized by the 
customer previously.

<br>

During this period, we also set up lines of communication and 
collaboration over Slack and GitHub. I made a temporary website 
containing a draft of the requirements and team/project intros.

## Week of 2/12
On Monday, my temporary website was replaced by Hannah and Tricia with 
the current (much nicer) website, hosted on GitHub within a separate 
repository.
