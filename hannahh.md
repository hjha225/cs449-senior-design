# Hannah's Weekly Updates! 

## Week of 2/5 
This week we met as a team on Monday. We discussed various topics that we wanted to talk about at our meeting with the customer on Wednesday.
We also discussed the website. We determined that each of us would do our own introduction. We wanted to rewrite the requirements given to
us by the customer so it made more sense to us. We also drew up a rough draft of what we thought the customer wanted for the GUI aspect.
On Wednesday, we met with our customer. We discussed some more specific details about what the desktop app will have and layed out specific
goals for the semester. We also set up a meeting with him for next week.

## Week of 2/12
We reworked our website after unforseen circumstances prevented us from presenting the website we wanted to. We spent part of Monday putting together this website. We also met with Mike and nailed down our requirements along with a stretch goal. I refamiliarized
myself with QT. I also spent time working on an unrelated assignment for the class.

## Week of 2/19 
Not much going on this week as I had to do a few other things for other classes. I did get the tab bar for the GUI done. No team meetings this week due to conflicting schedules. Planned a meeting with Mike for Monday and scheduled meetings for next week.
