# Hannah's Weekly Updates! 

## Week of 2/5 
This week we met as a team on Monday. We discussed various topics that we wanted to talk about at our meeting with the customer on Wednesday.
We also discussed the website. We determined that each of us would do our own introduction. We wanted to rewrite the requirements given to
us by the customer so it made more sense to us. We also drew up a rough draft of what we thought the customer wanted for the GUI aspect.
On Wednesday, we met with our customer. We discussed some more specific details about what the desktop app will have and layed out specific
goals for the semester. We also set up a meeting with him for next week.

## Week of 2/12
We reworked our website after unforseen circumstances prevented us from presenting the website we wanted to. We spent part of Monday putting together this website. We also met with Mike and nailed down our requirements along with a stretch goal. I refamiliarized
myself with QT. I also spent time working on an unrelated assignment for the class.

## Week of 2/19 
Not much going on this week as I had to do a few other things for other classes. I did get the tab bar for the GUI done. No team meetings this week due to conflicting schedules. Planned a meeting with Mike for Monday and scheduled meetings for next week.

## Week of 2/26
We met with Mike on Monday and came to the conclusion that we need to have better communication between the database and mobile teams. We also discussed how we should proceed going forward. We met with him again the following night and got a clearer picture of what he wanted the GUI itself to look like. We also outlined out next steps in greater detail. Shelby and Tricia couldn't make it to the Tuesday meeting so I met with them on Wednesday to fill them in on what happened. We met with Presentation U on Thursday to practice our presentation and do a couple of dry runs. Throughout the week, I worked on my portion of the design which was the user scenarios. Goals for next week are to meet with the database team and get connected and begin implementing a class so that we can connect and make calls to the database.
