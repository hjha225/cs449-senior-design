# Hannah's Weekly Updates! 

## Week of 2/5 
This week we met as a team on Monday. We discussed various topics that we wanted to talk about at our meeting with the customer on Wednesday.
We also discussed the website. We determined that each of us would do our own introduction. We wanted to rewrite the requirements given to
us by the customer so it made more sense to us. We also drew up a rough draft of what we thought the customer wanted for the GUI aspect.
On Wednesday, we met with our customer. We discussed some more specific details about what the desktop app will have and layed out specific
goals for the semester. We also set up a meeting with him for next week.

## Week of 2/12
We reworked our website after unforseen circumstances prevented us from presenting the website we wanted to. We spent part of Monday putting together this website. We also met with Mike and nailed down our requirements along with a stretch goal. I refamiliarized
myself with QT. I also spent time working on an unrelated assignment for the class. 
<br><br>

## Week of 2/19 
Not much going on this week as I had to do a few other things for other classes. I did get the tab bar for the GUI done. No team meetings this week due to conflicting schedules. Planned a meeting with Mike for Monday and scheduled meetings for next week.

## Week of 2/26
We met with Mike on Monday and came to the conclusion that we need to have better communication between the database and mobile teams. We also discussed how we should proceed going forward. We met with him again the following night and got a clearer picture of what he wanted the GUI itself to look like. We also outlined out next steps in greater detail. Shelby and Tricia couldn't make it to the Tuesday meeting so I met with them on Wednesday to fill them in on what happened. We met with Presentation U on Thursday to practice our presentation and do a couple of dry runs. Throughout the week, I worked on my portion of the design which was the user scenarios. Goals for next week are to meet with the database team and get connected and begin implementing a class so that we can connect and make calls to the database.

## Week of 3/5
I began implementing the database class that will allow us to connect but ran into some troubles and had to wait until after Spring Break in order to figure out the best solution. I was also going to add more functionality but again this needed to be discussed with my team after the break. 

## Week of 3/12  - Spring Break 

## Week of 3/19
Talked with Sulav on Monday in order to work out a few of the remaining issues that lurked with the project. Met with Mike on Wednesday to discuss what needs to be done by the end of the semester and set a date of having all code done by April 2nd (Same day that testing plan is due). Decided that I will be creating a new file type for the app itself and work on locally saving some of the data pulled from the database. Met again on Friday with Mike and the databases team at their request, discussed the final presentation briefly and discussed how the database was set up a bit so that we are able to complete our portion of the project. 

## Week of  3/26 
Wrote up the file containing the tests that I will be running to test my program and also the classes that would help organize that data pulled in from the data base and a basic save locally function. Spent lots of time debugging all of this code. Met with Mike and got him caught up on where we were. Also personally met with him on Friday to show him what our GUI looked like and let him mess with it a bit to be able to give us good feedback on it. 

## Week of 4/1 
I had one last function to implment this week and then it was time to debug. The majority of this week was spent debugging but it was not all for not as I now have code that is functioning. It's not perfect or pretty but it does what it's supposed to. I also added in some documentation and a README since building my code can be challenging due to the addition of BOOST libraries however I stand by the decision to use BOOST since it makes cross-platform file saving much easier. 

## Week of 4/9
I did a few last minute documentation changes as a result of the code review on Monday. We had a quick meeting with Mike on Wednesday to let him know we were on track to finish on time. We also had a meeting of all 3 teams on Thursday in order to plan out our presentation. I also started pulling together stuff for the presentation.
