# Weekly Updates! 

### Week of 2/5 
This week we met as a team on Monday. We discussed vasrious topics that we wanted to talk about at our meeting with the customer on Wednesday.
We also discussed the website. We determined that each of us would do our own introduction. We wanted to rewrite the requirements given to
us by the customer so it made more sense to us. We also drew up a rough draft of what we thought the customer wanted for the GUI aspect.
On Wednesday, we met with our customer. We discussed some more specific details about what the desktop app will have and layed out specific
goals for the semester. We also set up a meeting with him for next week.

### Week of 2/12
We reworked our website after unforseen circumstances prevented us from presenting the website we wanted to. We spent part of Monday putting
together this website.
