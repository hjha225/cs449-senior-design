# Tricia Sallee Weekly Updates

## Week of 2/5
We collaborated with our customer and the mobile and database teams by setting up a Slack. We exchanged email information.
Our group created a GroupMe to keep in contact. We had a meeting on Monday at 5pm. We discussed how to construct our webpage
and the possible languages we could use. Hannah and I created our requirements for the project. I completed an introduction
to put onto our website. Shelby created an initial website that we plan on improving.
