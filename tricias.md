# Tricia's Weekly Updates

## Week of 2/5
We collaborated with our customer and the mobile and database teams by setting up a Slack. We exchanged email information.
Our group created a GroupMe to keep in contact. We had a meeting on Monday at 5pm. We discussed how to construct our webpage
and the possible languages we could use. Hannah and I created our requirements for the project. I completed an introduction
to put onto our website. Shelby created an initial website that we plan on improving.

## Week of 2/12
Hannah and I met to change the website. I added all necessary pages to the website. On those that we have no information yet I put In Progress. We met with Mike on Wednesday to discuss the requirements. I changed to requirements according to this meeting. We also decided that Qt would be our GUI (Graphical User Interface) language if we ensure that we can customize the number of options on the ribbon. We discussed if we could use open-source or would need a licensed version. Mike consulted his lawyer on this matter and we are able to use the open-source version. I then installed Qt and took multiple tutorials to become familiar with it. I also created a calendar to display our schedule and created a page for it on the website.

## Week of 2/19
We designed how our GUI would look based upon the customer's request. There will be four main parts of the GUI. We used the week to get a rough draft of the GUI created. I created the part of the GUI that will display information that is received from the database. It currently uses different tabs to display Vechile Info, Occupant Info, and General Info. This will be the right side of the GUI. The top of the GUI will have a ribbon and the left of the GUI will be advanced tools. The middle of the GUI will be the drawing space. I also updated our calendar to reflect our meeting with the professor next week and our midterm presentation.

## Week of 2/26
This week we spent time finishing the GUI rough draft. We met with the customer to discuss how our communication with the other teams was going. We also set a goal of two weeks to have a working communication with the database team. Hannah is working on this portion of the project. Hannah and Sulav meet with the customer a second time for this week to discuss what the left panel of the GUI should look like. The tools displayed on the left panel should be an extension of the options the user has chosen on the top ribbon. Shelby is working on that part.

The customer also wants the part of the GUI that displays the information retrieved from the database for a job to be represented by three tabs on the right side of the screen. He wants the user to be able to click these tabs and then have the information swipe out and cover the drawing workspace. This is not how I initially implemented the right side so I am currently working to make this part of the GUI as the customer desires. I also updated our calendar because our midterm presentation was moved from Friday to Monday.

Sulav is working on a login page and the back end to go with it. We decided that it would be best to require a user to register from the desktop to ensure that only authorized people have access to the database. A user will be able to download the mobile version and use it to retrieve the reference material and only be able to save jobs to their phone if they do not have a username and password created by the desktop application.

## Week of 3/5 and 3/12
These past two weeks I fixed the right and top ribbon of the GUI. The top of the GUI now has tabs labeled File, Edit, and Draw. There is a quick tab above with AutoSave, Save, Save to Cloud, Send to Report, Undo and Redo. This will always be displayed. The 3D design area is visible upon open. The right tabs must be clicked to display related information. The tabs are General Info, Vehicle Info, Occupant Info, and Reference Materials. There is also a portion of the left part of the GUI that I completed. It will always remain at the top of the left panel no matter what the user has chosen on the top ribbon. These options consist of Cut, Copy, Paste, Snaps, Grid On/Off and Layers. I still need to change many of the buttons to have icons instead of just text. I also revised our requirements so that we are able to meet all of our goals. Our new requirements are to just get the connection with the database established, the GUI complete, and the basic file functions operating. We also completed our midterm presentation on Monday 3/5. I completed a few slides for this presentation.

## Week of 3/19
This week our group member Shelby Oldfield dropped the class. This required me to take on coding his portion of the GUI. I completed the left panel in regards to the edit tab. When a button is clicked the items displayed on the left panel change to advanced settings based upon the button that was clicked. We had a meeting with Mike for our group and decided that I would focus on the GUI, Hannah would focus on creating a file type and the save function, and Sulav would finish the login connection and then begin pulling a test case from the database so that we can be sure the connection to the database is working. We also had a collaborative meeting between all three teams. We got the database to create a test login and a simple test case so that Sulav can test the connection. They supplied the query statements needed. I completed the left panel of the GUI and am currently beginning my test plan.
