# Tricia's Weekly Updates

## Week of 2/5
We collaborated with our customer and the mobile and database teams by setting up a Slack. We exchanged email information.
Our group created a GroupMe to keep in contact. We had a meeting on Monday at 5pm. We discussed how to construct our webpage
and the possible languages we could use. Hannah and I created our requirements for the project. I completed an introduction
to put onto our website. Shelby created an initial website that we plan on improving.

## Week of 2/12
Hannah and I met to change the website. I added all necessary pages to the website. On those that we have no information yet I put In Progress. We met with Mike on Wednesday to discuss the requirements. I changed to requirements according to this meeting. We also decided that Qt would be our GUI language if we ensure that we can customize the number of options on the ribbon. We discussed if we could use open-source or would need a licensed version. Mike consulted his lawyer on this matter. I also created a calendar to display our schedule and created a page for it on the website.
